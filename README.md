# __Linked List with User Interface__ 
The program works with singly type of linked list.

The Linked List is written with Python3, and Tkinter module.  
I personally run it on Kali linux. But first you should install some of the modules. 
```bash
$ sudo apt-get install python-tk  
$ pip3 install playsound
$ pip3 install multiprocess

```
After the installation of the modules simply run it.
```bash
python3.9 Linked_List_UI.py
```
The program should look something like this

## __How to use__  
1. First of all we should click on the **Play Music** button to make our "testing Linked List" time more fun :) After clicking on the **Play Music** button this
window should pop up.

As long as the program works with multiprocessing you can continue to make list, add nodes etc.
2. We have to create new Linked List with **Create List** Button. If Linked list is created successfully this window should pop up.

3. Now we can add node from the beginning of the Linked list or from the bottom by clicking on **Add Node At The End** or **Add Node At the Beginning**.
After clicking this window should pop up.

4. You can Add more nodes from the end or beginning. Or you can insert them between two other nodes by clicking on **Insert Node**, this window will pop up.

First input is the value of the node, second input is the number of node after which you want to insert the new one.  
5. Now we can delete a specific node or all the nodes by clicking on **Remove Node** or **Remove All**. After clicking on **Remove Node** this window will pop up.

You should enter the number of node you want to remove.  

#### Thank you for reading and using this useless program  
By loading this to github, I wanted to finally learn markdown language. And to use it in practic :)
